# NodeJS README Generator
## Description
This lightweight CLI (Command Line Interface) tool will help you create a detailed and useful README.md file for your GitHub repositories. Utilizing the Inquirer and FS packages, we take input through the CLI and create a fresh README.md file. The extra import of generateLicense.js is necessary for the project's requirements.

## Installation
[Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) First off, you will need NodeJS if you do not already have it installed. If you do have it installed, simply navigate to the file directory in your CLI, and run `node install`.
## Usage
You can run in one step with `node run start` or simply `node index.js`. If you choose to run with a README.md in the current directory, it WILL BE OVERWRITTEN!
## Contribution
No further development will be done here. If you would like to tidy up and make it a bit more your own, feel free to fork.
